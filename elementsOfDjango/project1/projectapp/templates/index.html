    <h1>Documentation of Django Project Elements</h1>

    <h2>1. Project Directory</h2>
    <p>This is the root directory of your Django project. It contains the core project files, including settings, URL configuration, and project-specific files.</p>

    <h2>2. manage.py</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Root of the project directory.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A command-line utility that helps manage your Django project. It allows you to run server commands like <code>runserver</code>, <code>migrate</code>, <code>startapp</code>, and others.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>python manage.py runserver</code> – Starts the development server.</li>
        <li><code>python manage.py migrate</code> – Applies database migrations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. App Directory</h2>
    <p>If you create a new Django app, Django generates a folder for it. Each app is responsible for handling specific functionality within the project.</p>

    <h2>4. __init__.py</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Found in both the project and app directories.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Indicates that the directory should be treated as a Python package. It's generally an empty file but is essential for Python to recognize the directory as a package.</p>

    <h2>5. settings.py</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Inside the project directory (myproject/myproject/settings.py).</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This file contains the configuration settings for the Django project, such as database settings, installed apps, middleware, and more.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Sections:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INSTALLED_APPS:</strong> Lists the apps that are installed in your project.</li>
        <li><strong>DATABASES:</strong> Defines the database connection settings.</li>
        <li><strong>TEMPLATES:</strong> Manages settings for the template engine.</li>
        <li><strong>ALLOWED_HOSTS:</strong> Specifies the domains that can serve the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. urls.py</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Inside the project directory.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This file maps URL paths to views. It defines the URL structure of the entire project.</p>

    <h2>7. wsgi.py</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Inside the project directory (myproject/myproject/wsgi.py).</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This file provides an entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers (such as Gunicorn or uWSGI) to serve your project in production environments.</p>

    <h2>8. asgi.py</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Inside the project directory (myproject/myproject/asgi.py).</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides an entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers (such as Daphne or Uvicorn) to serve your project. ASGI is used for handling asynchronous protocols such as WebSockets.</p>

    <h2>9. App-Specific Files in myapp/</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>models.py:</strong> Defines the data models for the app. Each model is a Python class that subclasses <code>django.db.models.Model</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>views.py:</strong> Defines the logic for handling requests and returning responses. Each view function is tied to a URL in urls.py.</li>
        <li><strong>urls.py (App-level):</strong> Defines URL routes specific to the app.</li>
        <li><strong>admin.py:</strong> Registers models for the Django admin interface.</li>
        <li><strong>apps.py:</strong> Contains configuration for the app.</li>
        <li><strong>tests.py:</strong> Contains unit tests for the app's functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>migrations/:</strong> Stores migration files that track changes to models over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. db.sqlite3</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Root of the project directory.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The default SQLite database file that is created when you run migrations for the first time. You can change the database engine in <code>settings.py</code> to use other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.</p>

    <h2>11. __init__.py</h2>
    <p>The <code>__init__.py</code> file is used to mark a directory as a Python package. Without this file, Python wouldn't recognize the directory as a package, and you wouldn't be able to import files or modules from it in other parts of your project.</p>

    <h2>12. test.py</h2>
    <p>The <code>tests.py</code> file in a Django application is where you write unit tests and other types of tests to ensure the functionality of your code.</p>
